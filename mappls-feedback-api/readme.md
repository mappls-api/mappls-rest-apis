#### Request Headers
The API leverages OAuth 2.0 based security. Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their **client_id** and **client_secret** to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: “{token_type} {access_token}”.
1.  **Authorization:** “{token_type} {passport}”.   
2.  **Content-Type:** Defines the type of content being sent to the API. It must be set to **“application/x-www-form-urlencoded”.** Please note: sending any request without it or different than it would lead to a 400: Bad request.
    

### Security Type:
OAuth 2.0 based security using AES 256 and SHA-1.

• JSON: if the user passed in “/json”.
