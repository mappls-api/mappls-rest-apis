## Introduction

### Aerial Distance

Adding Aerial Distance API would help to calculate the distance between two points on the map. For example, you can measure the mileage in a straight line between two cities.

You can now easily estimate how big the lake near your house is, or just the **aerial distance** between Delhi and Mumbai is 1150.06 km (714.61 mi). Same time this **API  doesn't calculate road distance between two points.**
