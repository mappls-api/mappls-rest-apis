Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their client_id and client_secret to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: "{`token_type`} {`access_token`}”. <br><strong>Authorization</strong>: `token_type` `access_token`.<br><br>**Note**: <ol> <li> The response listed in the below documentation is ONLY indicative of the overall capabilities of Mappls's Search APIs. </li><li> Not all response parameters mentioned in the below documentation is assured to be present in all the use-cases.

      description: >-
        The Geolocation API returns a location on the basis of cell tower information that any mobile client can detect.<br>
        Any mobile user will send the information of all the connected or recently connected cell towers information in the API, Now API will articulate approximate user location on the basis of the provided cell towers information. Mappls will use its cell towers geo-location database to calculate the approximate geo-location of the user.<br><br>This APIs follow OAuth2 based security. **To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL.
