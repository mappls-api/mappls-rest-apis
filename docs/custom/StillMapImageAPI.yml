        description: >-
          The Still Map Image API creates a map based on URL parameters sent through a standard HTTP request and returns the map as an image which you can display on your application. The API lets you embed Mappls Maps image according to geo-position, pixel size and zoom level of the map on your application without requiring any dynamic page loading. The image can be a retina image and markers can be added to the image to indicate position of any object.
